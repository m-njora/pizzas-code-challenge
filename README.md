# PIZZA API

This is a Rails API for tracking pizza restaurants and their menus.

## Installation

To run this API locally, you must have Ruby and Rails installed on your machine. Once you have those installed, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal.
3. Run `bundle install` to install all necessary gems.
4. Run `rails db:migrate` to create the necessary database tables.
5. Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database with sample data.
6. Start the Rails server by running `rails s`.
7. Use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoints.

## Models
The following relationships have been established between the models:

* A Restaurant has many Pizzas through RestaurantPizza
* A Pizza has many Restaurants through RestaurantPizza
* A RestaurantPizza belongs to a Restaurant and belongs to a Pizza

## Validations
The RestaurantPizza model has a validation that ensures the price is between 1 and 30.

## Routes
The following routes have been implemented:

# GET /restaurants
Returns a list of all restaurants in JSON format:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
    "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "PizzArte",
    "address": "69 W 55th St, New York, NY 10019"
  }
]
```

# GET /restaurants/:id
Returns a single restaurant by ID in JSON format:

```
[
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sottocasa NYC",
  "address": "298 Atlantic Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11201",
  "pizzas": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Cheese",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Pepperoni",
      "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
    }
  ]
}

```
If the restaurant is not found, the API will return the following JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:
```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

DELETE /restaurants/:id
If the `Restaurant` exists, it should be removed from the database, along with
any `RestaurantPizza`s that are associated with it (a `RestaurantPizza` belongs
to a `Restaurant`, so you need to delete the `RestaurantPizza`s before the
`Restaurant` can be deleted).

After deleting the `Restaurant`, return an _empty_ response body, along with the
appropriate HTTP status code.

If the `Restaurant` does not exist, return the following JSON data, along with
the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "error": "Restaurant not found"
}
```

GET /pizzas
Return JSON data in the format below:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Cheese",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Pepperoni",
    "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese, Pepperoni"
  }
]
```

POST /restaurant_pizzas
This route should create a new `RestaurantPizza` that is associated with an
existing `Pizza` and `Restaurant`. It should accept an object with the following
properties in the body of the request:

```
{
  "price": 5,
  "pizza_id": 1,
  "restaurant_id": 3
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is created successfully, send back a response with the data
related to the `Pizza`:

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Cheese",
  "ingredients": "Dough, Tomato Sauce, Cheese"
}
```

If the `RestaurantPizza` is **not** created successfully, return the following
JSON data, along with the appropriate HTTP status code:

```
{
  "errors": ["validation errors"]
}

```
